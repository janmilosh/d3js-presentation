#D3.js Presentation

This presentation is intended to be run locally with the index.html file open along-side the browser window.

First clone this github repository.

To run the demo, navigate to the project root directory and start a server:

```sh
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000](localhost:8000) and open the the presentation index.html file in an editor. You now follow along with the demo and make your own changes if you wish.

Each demo has it's own complete and separate block of D3.js code in the index.html file. These blocks are labeled and separated by comments to make them easier to locate.
